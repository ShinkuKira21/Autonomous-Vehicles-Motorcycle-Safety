	abstract = {Usability is a quality factor that pointed out as being one of the most important factors in the acceptance of software engineering systems by end users. This can be explained by the increasing number of studies addressing the integration of the usability evaluation at the development process. However, most of these proposals aim to drive the selection of adequate alternative transformation according to a set of usability requirements. This paper proposed an approach that considers the interactive systems generation process as a usability optimization problem by the model-driven engineering approach. The aims was to generate all possible concrete user interfaces from a given abstract user interface. Then, the usability optimization process selects the optimal concrete user interface for a specific context of use.},

	abstract = {Usability engineering draws on the response of users to determine the viability of interactive systems and interfaces. Measurability parameters are generally either subjective, wherein users' preferences are evaluated, or objective, wherein users' capabilities for utilizing the system are studied. As expected, there is a positive correlation between user preference and performance, since people are generally motivated to perform well at systems which are enjoyable to use. A metastudy is presented which considers some 1,937 research papers measuring user preference and performance in system studies. Most of the papers, culled from journals dealing with human/computer interaction, look at studies where users test competitive software packages for a site license, or where development groups consider menuing functions for ease of development and usage.},

	volume = {63},
	shorttitle = {Improving the information development process},
	abstract = {Purpose: This article presents a refined iterative development model that may be used to improve the processes related to information development. Specifically, the model is designed to facilitate rapid and incremental delivery and increased quality and efficiency. Method: The refined iterative development model is based on an analysis of models from across a range of industries. The analysis was designed to clearly define what a development model is, the basic phases it contains, and various common uses. The approach to this project was from the perspective of a practicing technical communication professional and project manager. Results: The analysis revealed that development models are visual, conceptual, representational, process-oriented, inventive, and both sequential and iterative. The basic phases common to development models are, generally speaking, Discovery, Planning, Implementation, Review, Refinement, and Release (or Deployment). Common uses include sharing knowledge, facilitating success, enhancing credibility, and demonstrating progress. Conclusion: The analysis and comparison allows for a deeper understanding of what a development model is and how a refined iterative development model can be used to improve processes related to information development.
