	abstract = {Mobility is a basic necessity of contemporary society and it is a key factor in global economic development. The basic requirements for the transport of people and goods are: safety and duration of travel, but also a number of additional criteria are very important: energy saving, pollution, passenger comfort.

Due to advances in hardware and software, automation has penetrated massively in transport systems both on infrastructure and on vehicles, but man is still the key element in vehicle driving. However, the classic concept of ‘human-in-the-loop’ in terms of ‘hands on’ in driving the cars is competing aside from the self-driving startups working towards so-called ‘Level 4 autonomy’, which is defined as “a self-driving system that does not requires human intervention in most scenarios”.

In this paper, a conceptual synthesis of the autonomous vehicle issue is made in connection with the artificial intelligence paradigm. It presents a classification of the tasks that take place during the driving of the vehicle and its modeling from the perspective of traditional control engineering and artificial intelligence. The issue of autonomous vehicle management is addressed on three levels: navigation, movement in traffic, respectively effective maneuver and vehicle dynamics control. Each level is then described in terms of specific tasks, such as: route selection, planning and reconfiguration, recognition of traffic signs and reaction to signaling and traffic events, as well as control of effective speed, distance and direction. The approach will lead to a better understanding of the way technology is moving when talking about autonomous cars, smart/intelligent cars or intelligent transport systems. Keywords: self-driving vehicle, artificial intelligence, deep learning, intelligent transport systems.},

	abstract = {Driver assist technologies have reached the tipping point and are poised to take control of most, if not all, aspects of the driving task. Proponents of automated driving (AD) are enthusiastic about its promise to transform mobility and realize impressive societal benefits. This paper is an attempt to carefully examine the potential of AD to realize safety benefits, to challenge widely-held assumptions and to delve more deeply into the barriers that are hitherto largely overlooked. As automated vehicle (AV) technologies advance and emerge within a ubiquitous cyber-physical world they raise additional issues that have not yet been adequately defined, let alone researched. Issues around automation, sociotechnical complexity and systems resilience are well known in the context of aviation and space. There are important lessons that could be drawn from these applications to help inform the development of automated driving. This paper argues that for the foreseeable future, regardless of the level of automation, a driver will continue to have a role. It seems clear that the benefits of automated driving, safety and otherwise, will accrue only if these technologies are designed in accordance with sound cybernetics principles, promote effective human-systems integration and gain the trust by operators and the public.},

This study aims to determine the factors that affect the lateral clearance of motorcycle riders as they travel between two lanes of mixed traffic at signalized urban intersections in developing countries. In this study, an onboard measurement device was developed to measure the lane-filtering behavior of motorcycle riders. It was installed on a test motorcycle to continuously record the lateral clearance, riding behavior, and surrounding traffic conditions. Thirty participants rode the test motorcycle through a signalized urban intersection. Multilevel linear regression was applied to analyze the relationship between lateral clearance and relevant variables at a significance level of 0.05. The instant speed and side of the filtering motorcycle, condition of the lateral vehicle, type of lateral vehicle, and riding frequency of the motorcycle rider significantly influenced the lateral clearance. The findings of this study can contribute to filtering lane management, connected autonomous vehicles, and microscopic traffic simulations for motorcycles traveling in mixed traffic at signalized urban intersections.},

	abstract = {Lidar imaging systems are one of the hottest topics in the optronics industry. The need to sense the surroundings of every autonomous vehicle has pushed forward a race dedicated to deciding the final solution to be implemented. However, the diversity of state-of-the-art approaches to the solution brings a large uncertainty on the decision of the dominant final solution. Furthermore, the performance data of each approach often arise from different manufacturers and developers, which usually have some interest in the dispute. Within this paper, we intend to overcome the situation by providing an introductory, neutral overview of the technology linked to lidar imaging systems for autonomous vehicles, and its current state of development. We start with the main single-point measurement principles utilized, which then are combined with different imaging strategies, also described in the paper. An overview of the features of the light sources and photodetectors specific to lidar imaging systems most frequently used in practice is also presented. Finally, a brief section on pending issues for lidar development in autonomous vehicles has been included, in order to present some of the problems which still need to be solved before implementation may be considered as final. The reader is provided with a detailed bibliography containing both relevant books and state-of-the-art papers for further progress in the subject.},

	abstract = {By transmitting lasers and processing laser returns, LiDAR (light detection and ranging) perceives the surrounding environment through distance measurements. Because of high ranging accuracy, LiDAR is one of the most critical sensors in autonomous driving systems. Revolving around the 3D point clouds generated from LiDARs, plentiful algorithms have been developed for object detection/tracking, environmental mapping, or localization. However, a LiDAR’s ranging performance suffers under adverse weather (e.g. fog, rain, snow etc.), which impedes full autonomous driving in all weather conditions. This article focuses on analyzing the performance of a typical time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR under fog environment. By controlling the fog density within CEREMA Adverse Weather Facility, the relations between the ranging performance and fogs are both qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. Furthermore, based on the collected data, a machine learning based model is trained to predict the minimum fog visibility that allows successful ranging for this type of LiDAR. The revealed experimental results and methods are helpful for ToF LiDAR specifications from automotive industry.},

Moreover, perceptions of self-drive cars are likely to be highly dependent on the lived-experience of different road user types. Motorcyclists have high impressions of road-vulnerability and distrust for other road users. This distrust stems from the evidence that the vast number of motorcycle crashes occur as a consequence of other-driver error. We therefore hypothesised that compared with car drivers, vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists would report high levels of other-driver distrust, but high levels of trust in self-drive cars. We conducted semi-structured interviews with motorcyclists and car drivers and found that motorcyclists are indeed distrustful of other drivers but have higher levels of trust for self-drive cars compared with car drivers, while car drivers have low levels of trust for self-drive cars, but high levels of trust for other drivers. Motorcyclists were also more likely to report a perspective of trust that centred around their own personal safety on the road.

However, the users are at risk of involvement due to the failures of technology, which have been given growing attention by many research studies. Hence, it is essential to understand the technology’s acceptance and risk perception by the end users under mixed traffic conditions. This paper aims to provide a review of the studies that involve the perceptions of the public regarding their intention to adopt AVs and the risk-taking behaviour of road users with AVs. In this line, the existing studies are classified based on adoption intention-related studies and public risk perceptions. Further, it is also essential to understand the factors to be considered, survey approach, number of survey samples, and methods adopted by various existing studies in order to understand the future direction related to public adoption intentions of AVs. Moreover, the study identified the factors collected in various studies, which will be helpful to understand which factors are less explored or have a high contribution to the adoption intention of AVs. Furthermore, this study has proposed a methodological framework that paves the way for how to approach studies related to the intention to adopt AVs and contributing factors to the risk perception of AVs. The studies’ insights about survey method, number of samples, methodology to be considered and the contributing factors towards adoption intentions of AV technology are useful to policymakers in developing countries.},

Traffic is one of the major sources of death and injury in modern society–human error causing about ninety percent of traffic accidents. Prima facie this yields a strong ethical obligation to further the development and adoption of AVs. However, moral desirability cannot be analyzed solely in terms of increased safety. Broad societal adoption of automated vehicles will entail many ethical issues. One cluster of ethical issues concerns the role of non-human entities occupying positions that usually are reserved for proper moral agents: how should AVs make decisions? And who could be held responsible for their choices? Another cluster of issues concerns the impact widespread adoption of AVs could have on society: which social groups would be negatively affected by the widespread adoption of AVs? Is society becoming too reliant on technology and which potential for abuse is entailed by this dependence? Should citizens remain free to drive vehicles themselves, though they make traffic less safe for everyone? In this paper, I advocate a cautionary position, mindful of the inevitability of technological progress and its great potential, attempting to highlight the obligation to steer this development towards an ethically acceptable trajectory.},
